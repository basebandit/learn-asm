 12 String and Arrays
   * String primitive instructions
   * Selected String Procedures
   * Two-Dimensional Arrays
   * Searching and Sorting Integer Arrays
 13 Structures and Macros
   * Structures
   * Macros
 14 Conditional Assembly Directives
   * Checking For missing Arguments
   * Default Argument Initializers

 The above list is not a definitive list but a rough guide on the major concepts to grasp while trying to understand
 or master assembly (x86).Syntax(Intel/AT&T) really doesn't matter,the concepts is of much importance though.
